    "# Question 3: Pascal's Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to understand Pascal's triangle is by Binomial Theorem: i.e. the coefficients of $(a+b)^n$ gives the $n^{th}$ row of the triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "From binomial theorem, $$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{r=1}^{n} {n\\choose r} a^r b^{n-r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the coefficients are $n\\choose r$ for $r = 1,2, \\dots n.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a function nCr which gives $n\\choose r = \\frac{n!}{r! (n-r)!}$. Since negative factorial is not defined, $n - r \\geq 0$ or $n \\geq r$. Thus, we raise a value error if $n \\leq r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "next we define pascal which takes in an integer n, or the number of rows of the pascal's triangle we would like to print. we iterate through $1$ to $(n+1)$ because for the $n$ layers, we have $(n+1)$ rows. Similarly, for the $k^{th}$ row, we have $k+1$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each row k, we print ${k\\choose r}$ with $r = 0,1,2, \\dots k$. This gives us the $k^{th}$ row of the Pascal's Triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "print a blank after each row iteration to move to the next line after each $'k'$\n",
